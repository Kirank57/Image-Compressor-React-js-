              <h3>Lightning Fast Processing</h3>
              <p>
                Leveraging WebAssembly and modern JavaScript, we deliver
                near-instant compression even for high-resolution images.
                Process batches of images in seconds, not minutes.

              <p>
                Your images are processed 100% in your browser. We don't store,
                track, or analyze your filesâ€”unlike cloud-based alternatives
                that retain your data.
